Every NNS proposal will be mirrored onto the WaterNeuron DAO. Neurons holders will be able to vote on the SNS proposal. Whatever has the majority one hour before the expiration of the NNS proposal will be voted with the two neurons. If yes and no have the same number of votes, the neurons will vote no.

This approach ensures to have the maximum rewards as all the proposals are voted on programmatically. It provides better governance decisions as everyone can vote with their neuron.
