# Airdrop

WTN will be distributed to nICP users following the tiers described below. A total of 4.48M WTN will be distributed to nICP stakers. The airdrop will be claimable once every WTN has been allocated, meaning a total of 10M ICP has been deposited into the protocol.

_Example:_ For every ICP deposited within the initial tier of 0 to 80,000 ICP, depositors will receive 8 WTN tokens per ICP. Therefore, a deposit of 10 ICP in this tier will yield 80 WTN tokens.
